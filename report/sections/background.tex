\section{Background}

The remote pair programming was introduced in order to help two people or a team of coworkers working on the same task, trying to solve it as unit while  by sharing knowledge for each other. By this approach, it means that one person have an idea in mind, share it in open document to the other person. The other person acts as an observer while studying what his partner is sharing. Thereafter, both persons will have discussion which will lead for the solution of their task they were looking for.
