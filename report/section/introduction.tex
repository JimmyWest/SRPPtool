\section{Introduction}

In Pair Programming, two programmers  work side by side at the same computer and collaborating on the same algorithm, code, or test [1]. Remote Pair Programming (RPP) is known as a virtual Pair Programming, where programmers are working as in Pair Programming but not side by side at the same machine. In RPP programmers are using digital voice communication and often a screen sharing tool or some collaborative development tool. Google Drive is a widely known collaborative tool for documents, presentations and sharing files [2]. 

The security and privacy of data, source code, is important when development are made in a distributed manner. As source code are distributed over Internet. Some RPP tools solves this problem by forcing the users to have secure communication links between working peers. Examples of secure communication links are Secure Shell (SSH), Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Virtual Private Network (VPN). They requires that all users are working inside a secure environment. 

Our project is to develop and implement a concept of how a Secure Remote Pair Programming tool is made possible. This makes it possible to RPP from everywhere and does not requires any secure communication links. By having the tool application to securely encrypt all messages by itself in a sophisticated and logical manner, without the use of SSH, SSL, VPN or any other secure communication.
