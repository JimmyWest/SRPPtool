\subsection{Communication}

The communication is between the server and the clients.Every client has a main communication to the server and one communication link for each file. 

An example scenario: There are three clients connected to the server, client one has two files open and client two has four files open and client three has one file open. For this case,client one has three communication links, client two has five communication links and client three has two communication links open. In this scenario, the server holds a total of 10 communication links.
