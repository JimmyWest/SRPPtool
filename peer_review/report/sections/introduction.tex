\section{Introduction}

In pair programming, two programmers  work side by side at the same computer and collaborating on the same algorithm, code, or test. Remote Pair Programming (RPP) tool can be used to give the programmers the possibility to collaborate remotely. The advantage of using a secured RPP is that students or any team can collaborate on a given  task. Moreover,  it allows them to work independently on their own computer while sharing data for each other in real-time. Furthermore, it can help reinforce the team working, thereby improving their productivity. Some of the RPP tools out there does not support secure communication, and are recommended to be used over internal secured communication links. 

A Secured Remote Pair Programming (SRPP) tool is a collaborative software engineering approach that supports remote pair programming based on unsecured communication links as the communication are secured.
